# QUESTION 1
# Write a program that uses a while loop to print the numbers from 1 to 20.
# If the number is 7 or 15, it should also print out "Hey, that's my lucky number!"

number = 1

while number <= 20
  if number == 7 or number == 15   #can use || or or 
    puts number.to_s + " Hey, that's my lucky number!"
  else
    puts number
  end
  number = number + 1
end

# QUESTION 2
# Finish annotating the code below.
# Then run the code to see if the output matches your annotation.
number = 0             # 1
while 2 > number       # 2 6 9
  if number < 1        # 3 7
    puts number        # 4
  end
  number = number + 1  # 5 8
end
puts "Done!"           #     10

# 1: number is 0
# 2: (2 is greater than 0, continue)
# 3:  0 is less than 2
# 4: print 0
# 5: number becomes 1
# 6: 2 is greater than 1 continue
# 7:  1 is not less than one
# 8: number becomes 2
# 9: 2 is not greater than 2. End loop
# 10: Prints "Done!"
