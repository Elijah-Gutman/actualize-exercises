        <h2> How I got here</h2>
        <p> To tell a very long story within a few short words I spent most of my twenties
            in political advococy and fundraising. Like anyone with a bit of emotional
            maturity could tell you, politics is a souless vapid means of wealth 
            accumulation. Its enriching oneself at the cost of everyone else.
            Abbrivated: I now seek to actually add value and productivity
            to this world. The best way I see to do that is by using my propensity and
            proclivity for problem solving as a means to do so. Enter a desire to 
            become and software engineer. It also helps that everyone in my immidiate circle are 
            already in tech.
