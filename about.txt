Hi My name is Elijah Gutman I currently work in the medical engineering field. Its entertaining but
it is not by any means efficient time wise like pretty much anything within the
medically associated fields. Long story short it requires way to much of my time
 to be able to make a sufficient income. I was intending on going back to school
  to learn how to code as my brother, my girlfriend, and my best friend are all 
  already in the field and encouraged me to join them. They said many of their coleagues
  were either self taught or took programming bootcamp courses and encouraged me to do
  the same and save myself a lot of time and money compared to getting a degree
  in Computer science or software engineering. And here I am.
